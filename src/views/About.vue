    <h1>About the Club</h1>
    <p>The club was founded in 2003 by Ewan Tempero Sensei and Tom Davies Sensei. The two met in 2002 when Ewan Sensei ran some beginners' classes in order to create a club. At the time Ewan Sensei had a Nidan in Goju Ryu and Tom Sensei had Shodan ranks in Zen Do Kai Karate Kickboxing, Shin Do Kempo Karate and a Nidan in Yoshukai Karate.</p>

    <p>The club is affiliated with the International Okinawan Goju Ryu Federation (IOGKF), an international body dedicated to preserving the art of the Okinawan Goju-Ryu Karate, as well as the New Zealand IOGKF affiliate, the IOGKFNZ. This gives club members access to expert instructions both nationally and internationally. </p>
