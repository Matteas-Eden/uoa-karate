There will be group lunch. There will be fun in the sun. There will be walking. And of course there will be training! Make sure you pack your own lunch, sunblock, appropriate shoes for light hiking and a fighting spirit. Training will be done in mufti so don’t worry you don’t need to wear your uniform in public (unless of course you want to).
