# Design ideas and inspiration

- Min size is 375px x 667px (iPhone 6)
- Max size is 1920px x 1080px
- Shoud make people interested and excited about the club
  - needs colours
  - pictures could help
- Could have a hero image
- Could have a fixed header or a sticky menu

Menu could be underneath the hero image, and as you scroll it sticks to the top?
